# **Sunrise Table Tennis Club**

This website showcase Sunrise Table Tennis Club, a fictional organization that houses table tennis players and enthusiasts of all ages. This training project, prepared by [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/full-stack-engineer-career-path), has been an invaluable exercise in enhancing my knowledge on the application of CSS techniques on making websites responsive.

## Project Prompt

In this project, you’ll be building your own club group page that will dynamically respond as you adjust the size of your screen!​ You can base it on real-life organization you belong to or make one up! You’ll get to choose everything about your page: the club name, the page layout and styling, any images that you want to use, and more! You can check out our [example site](https://content.codecademy.com/PRO/independent-practice-projects/responsive-club-site/example-site/index.html) for some inspiration and experiment with what elements are responsive. We’ll provide the full code for this site in the solution section at the end of this project.

Your project should demonstrate many of the responsive design tools you learned. In our example project, we use percentages and relative units, such as em and rem, in our CSS to size and position page elements. We also made our website responsive by incorporating media queries to resize elements based on the size of the screen
